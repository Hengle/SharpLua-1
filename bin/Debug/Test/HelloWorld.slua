-- There are a couple ways to print hello world in #Lua.
-- If you know Lua, you should know the first two:
print("Hello World!")
io.write("Hello World!\n")
-- If you dont know Lua, those two functions will both write 'Hello World!' to the console.
-- io.write does not write an EndOfLine character, so you need to specify that with '\n'.
-- A new way in #Lua is to use the console module
console.write"Hello World!\n"
console.writeline"Hello World!"
-- And in color:
console.writecolor("red", "Hello World, I am Red Text!")
-- With the writecolor function you can use any value of the System.ConsoleColor enum.
-- The only formats of text allowed for color are 'Red' or 'red', not something like 'RED' or 'rEd'.
