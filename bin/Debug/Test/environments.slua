-- this script shows how you can load and save the _G (global environment) through sessions
-- this doesn't work when using require, dofile, openfile, etc.
-- this is because the environment is passed through a variable, not LuaRuntime.GlobalEnvironment.
-- so to see this script actually work, copy/paste or type it into SharpLua.

-- the saving function is saveenv(filename)
saveenv("environment.bin")

-- to prove it works, lets set a variable
hello = function() end
print(hello)

-- load environment from file
loadenv("environment.bin")

-- look! the "hello" function is gone!
print(hello)
