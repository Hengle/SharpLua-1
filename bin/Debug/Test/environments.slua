-- this script shows how you can load and save the _G (global environment) through sessions

-- the saving function is saveenv(filename)
saveenv("environment.bin")

-- to prove it works, lets set a variable
hello = function() end
print(hello)

-- load environment from file
loadenv("environment.bin")

-- look! the "hello" function is gone!
print(hello)
