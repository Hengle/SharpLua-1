-- you can copy tables:
tbl2 = { ["hi"] = "hi" }
table.copy(tbl, tbl2)
-- and then you can access it, because its in the new table
print(tbl.hi)
tbl2.hi = math.pi
print(tbl.hi)
print(tbl2.hi)

-- you can print tables also
-- using table.dump, table.print, and table.printcontents
table.dump(tbl)
-- but if you have some varaible pointing to its parent, such as _G, 
-- because you can access it like _G._G._G._G._G._G, it may cause weird printing
table.dump(_G)
